##  Prosperity 3 Algorithmic Trading Challenge

> *Ranked in the top \~10% globally (1271 out of 12,000+ teams) and 223rd in India*

### About the Competition

Prosperity 3 is a large-scale **algorithmic trading competition** where over 12,000 teams worldwide developed trading bots to operate in a simulated market.
The challenge focused on designing, implementing, and optimizing trading strategies for multiple synthetic assets, such as:

* Commodities (e.g., Rainforest Resin, Kelp, Squid Ink)
* Complex basket products (e.g., PICNIC\_BASKET1, PICNIC\_BASKET2)
* Options and derivatives (e.g., VOLCANIC\_ROCK\_VOUCHERS)

Participants competed to maximize profit while managing risk, exploiting arbitrage opportunities, and adapting to market volatility.

### ⚙ My Approach

In this repository, you'll find the core trading bots and strategies I developed during the competition, including:

*  **Mean reversion and momentum strategies**: To profit from short-term price deviations.
*  **Basket arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences between baskets and their components.
*  **Fair price estimation**: Using EMA, SMA, and microprice models.
*  **Adaptive hedging & risk management**: Adjusting positions based on volatility and exposure.

These strategies were iteratively improved and tested against historical market data to achieve higher profitability.
